# About me

I am a computer scientist, data scientist and I am especially interested in 
* machine learning, 
* finances, 
* trading, 
* data engineering,
* and much more...

In my free time when I don't code for work, I code for myself :D 
I also trade a bit and I like exploring the financial data...

My favorite languages are python (super fast to code) and C++ (super fast to run).

My background is computer science which I studied first at RWTH Aachen University (B.Sc.) and then at ETH Zurich (M.Sc.).

Although I've been moving a bit, I am now living in Zurich.
