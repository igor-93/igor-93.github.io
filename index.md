# About me

I am a computer scientist with interests in data science, machine learning, finances, trading, data engineering...
In my free time when I don't code for work, I code for myself :D I also trade a bit and I like exploring the financial data...

My favorite languages are python (super fast to code) and C++ (super fast to execute).

My background is computer science which I studied first at RWTH Aachen University (B.Sc.) and then at ETH Zurich (M.Sc.).

### Contact

Since I am receiving lots of spam emails, I would be happy if you would contact me on 
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/igor-pesic/). 
You can also check my [Github](https://www.github.com/igor-93)

# Projects

Since I started this page just recently, I am bit lazy to fill it with all of the projects I've done so far, 
so I will only mention one for now...

It is a market notification tool. More about it [here](./market_alerts.html).
