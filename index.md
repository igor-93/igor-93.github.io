# About me

I am a computer scientist, data scientist and I am especially interested in 
* machine learning
* finances
* trading
* computer vision
* data engineering
* and much more...

In my free time when I don't code for work, I code for myself :D 
I also trade a bit and I like exploring the financial data...

My favorite languages are python (super fast to code) and C++ (super fast to run).

My background is computer science which I studied first at RWTH Aachen University (B.Sc.) and then at ETH Zurich (M.Sc.).

Although I've been moving a bit, I am now living in Zurich.

Since I started this page just recently, I am a bit lazy to fill it with all of the projects I've done so far, 
so I will only mention one for now...

It is a [Market Event Notification Tool](./market-alerts).
